# High Concept

## One-liner
A silent research station drifts in orbit. You can’t see inside—only a fragile emergency terminal link remains.
You remotely inhabit whatever maintenance bot you can reach, upgrading sensors and tools, restoring systems,
and piecing together the station’s fate.

## Player fantasy
- You are the **operator**: clever, methodical, always working with imperfect information.
- You “see” through **sensor skins** that reshape the map (dirt/cleanliness → temperature → radiation → structural stress).
- You turn a dead station into a legible story by **recovering data** and **rebuilding power**.

## Pillars
1. **Exploration via constraints**: low-bitrate UI + narrow sensors → meaningful uncertainty.
2. **Puzzle-forward roguelike**: hazards and obstacles are primarily solved, not fought.
3. **Mystery as progression**: every restored subsystem unlocks new evidence and new ways to interpret it.
4. **Procedural but coherent**: runs differ, but the station always has a solvable critical path and a satisfying reveal arc.

## Core loop (summary)
Connect → move bot → discover obstacles/hazards → use tools/systems → restore power/access → recover evidence → deduce → reach objective.

## Run objectives
Each run has:
- **Primary objective** (win condition): e.g., restore reactor + transmit research, or rescue survivors in cryo, or purge infection.
- **2–4 optional objectives**: e.g., find captain, retrieve black box, re-enable station comms, recover “sealed” dataset.

## Tone
- Suspenseful, clinical, slightly lonely.
- Not gore-forward; horror can be “systems horror” (life support readouts, missing crew, creeping anomalies).

## Scope guardrails
- Keep combat minimal/optional; avoid complex enemy AI at first.
- Prefer puzzles templated + parameterized over bespoke hand-authored puzzles.
- Keep assets light: ASCII/tiles, limited animation, heavy on UI.

## The “bandwidth ladder”
Early: monochrome text + sparse map.
Mid: color unlock + better map modes + low-res “still frames.”
Late: multi-bot control, station-wide sensors, automated routines, clearer story reconstruction.
