# Mystery & Narrative System

## Philosophy
The mystery should be *discoverable* and *deducible*:
- The player collects fragments (logs, personal notes, sensor anomalies).
- The player forms hypotheses.
- The game rewards correct deductions by unlocking codes, routes, or explanations.

## Crew generation
Each run generates:
- 8–20 crew members (scale with station size)
- Roles (captain, engineer, medic, security, scientist, contractor)
- Relationships (friendship, rivalry, secret affair, blackmail)
- 1–3 secrets (illicit research, smuggling, sabotage, false identity)
- Fates (missing, dead, in cryo, escaped)

## Evidence types
- System logs (power events, door access, reactor alarms)
- Personal comms (redacted email/chat fragments)
- Lab notes (partial experimental results)
- Physical traces revealed by sensors (coolant trail, heat scorch, blood residue)
- “Still frames” (if cameras restored)

## Deductions (lightweight MVP)
Start with a simple deduction board:
- Identify **who** used a door at a time
- Match **badge IDs** to crew names
- Infer **cause of failure** (core disaster type)
Correct deductions unlock:
- higher clearance
- hidden rooms
- override codes
- new endgame objective options

## Narrative assembly
Use a template-driven “incident timeline”:
1. Normal operations
2. Trigger event (chosen by secret/mode)
3. Escalation (failure cascades)
4. Collapse (communications loss)
5. Aftermath (current hazards)

Evidence is generated to support the timeline, with controlled gaps.

## Avoiding content explosion
Prefer:
- a small number of incident archetypes (6–10)
- parameterized clues
- reusable log templates with variable slots (names, locations, times, subsystem IDs)
