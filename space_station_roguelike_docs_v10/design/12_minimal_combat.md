# Minimal Combat & Threat Model

## Goal
Threat should increase tension without turning the game into a combat sim.

## Threat sources (prefer systemic)
- Fire, smoke, vacuum, radiation
- Power surges, door malfunctions, security lockdowns
- Time pressure (link stability, escalating risk)

## Hostile entities (rare; puzzle-first)
### Malfunctioning security drone (MVP optional)
Behavior:
- simple patrol + line-of-sight zap
Counterplay:
- cut power to corridor
- trap with doors
- EMP burst module (rare)
- outrun using mobility upgrades

### Infestation (later)
- blocks paths, corrodes tools
Counterplay:
- seal vents, purge atmosphere locally, disinfectant spray

## Combat rules (keep simple)
- No complex aiming.
- Resolution is deterministic.
- Best play is avoidance/control, not fighting.
