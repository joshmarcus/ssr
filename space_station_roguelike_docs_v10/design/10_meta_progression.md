# Meta Progression (Roguelite)

## Philosophy
Meta progression should:
- widen options, not gate completion
- preserve the mystery feeling (don’t spoil outcomes)
- be readable and small in scope

## Meta currencies (pick 1 for MVP)
- **Recovered research** (primary): used to unlock terminal modules.
- **Salvage credits** (secondary): used to unlock starting chassis/attachments.
Keep numbers small and milestones-based to avoid grind.

## Unlock types
### Terminal modules (operator-side)
- Better map readability (labels, auto-legend)
- Additional macro commands (e.g., quick “scan” variants)
- Slightly faster “probe bot” turnaround
- Color unlock as a *module* (or story unlock)

### Starting loadout options
- Choose starting chassis (janitor rover vs maintenance spider)
- Choose 1 starting attachment (common tier)
- Choose 1 starting “perk” (e.g., +1 link stability)

### Cosmetic (nice-to-have)
- Terminal themes, sound packs, cursor styles

## Hybrid run persistence
Some progress can persist *within a run* after bot loss:
- station systems you restored remain restored
- doors you unlocked stay unlocked
- evidence you recovered stays in your operator archive

## Preventing runaway power
- Cap starting advantage (e.g., only 1 attachment).
- Keep high-tier sensors/tools as in-run finds.
